## GROUPS ##

What groups do we need, and what should each of their permissions be:

# Regional Groups #
    - Nigeria Office
        -> Has access to DataPoints where region is Nigeria ( or NG is parent)
    - Pakistan Office
        -> Has access to Datapoitns where region is Pakistan
    - Afganistan Office
        -> Has access to Datapoitns where region is Afganistan

    ** Perhaps i need to think about a "Parent Region ID" here to make permissions simpler **

# Read / Write Groups #
    - Insert Data Point Group
        -> this group will be allowed to create new datapoints
    - Update Data Point Group
        -> this group will be allowed to update datapoints
    - Delete Data Point Group
        -> this group will be allowed to delete datapoints


- Superuser
    -> Has the ability to view, insert, update, and delete all models.
    -> For now, this will be the only group that can create objects outside of "datapoints"
